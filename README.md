# EvictionSponge
The EvictionSponge project is a web-hosted service that allows users to check their eligibility for eviction record expungement and, if they are eligible, provide the necessary legal documentation already filled in.

## Project Tech Stack
EvictionSponge is built using [React.js](https://www.reactjs.org/) for the front end interface and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) for the backend framework. Frontend packages are managed with NPM.
